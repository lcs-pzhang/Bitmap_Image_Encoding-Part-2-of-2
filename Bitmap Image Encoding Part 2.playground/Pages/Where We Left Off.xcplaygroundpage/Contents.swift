 ## Decoding a simpler bitmap
 The rules for decoding the simpler bitmap were:
 
 * When a 0 is encountered, make the square black.
 * Otherwise (when a 1 is encountered) make the square white.
 
 Run the playground several times.
 
 Notice that the image on the right matches the random 0's and 1's that are generated, following the rules laid out above.

 ### Check the results
 Does the output match what you'd expect, based on the values in the encoded string?
 
 How do you know?
 
 Write your ideas in the code comment below.
 */
// I notice that the string is always a different number. The number and the order of black and white squares are different each time.

// I know this because of the conditional statement where if the number is 0 it will always start with a black square. If not, it will begin with white squares. The string will always be different because there's no restraints for how long or short it can be.
